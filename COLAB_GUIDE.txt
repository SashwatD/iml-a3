HOW TO TRAIN ON GOOGLE COLAB (T4 GPU)
========================================

STEP 1: Prepare Project Zip
----------------------------
On your local machine:
1. Open PowerShell in project folder
2. Run: Compress-Archive -Path * -DestinationPath iml-a3.zip
   (This creates iml-a3.zip with all your files)

STEP 2: Upload to Colab
------------------------
1. Go to: https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Click "Upload" and select: colab_training.ipynb
3. Runtime → Change runtime type → T4 GPU → Save

STEP 3: Run Training
--------------------
Run cells in order (Shift+Enter):

Cell 1: Check GPU
Cell 2: (Skip this header)
Cell 3: Upload iml-a3.zip when prompted
Cell 4: (Skip - only if using Drive)
Cell 5: (Skip - only if using GitHub)
Cell 6: (Skip this header)
Cell 7: Install dependencies (~2 min)
Cell 8: (Skip this header)
Cell 9: Verify everything loaded
Cell 10: (Skip this header)
Cell 11: START TRAINING (~2-3 hours on T4)
Cell 12: (Skip this header)
Cell 13: Monitor progress (run anytime)
Cell 14: (Skip this header)
Cell 15: Download results when done

STEP 4: Get Results
-------------------
After training completes:
1. Run Cell 15 to download training_results.zip
2. Extract on your local machine
3. Copy contents to: models/approach_1_2/

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Q: "No GPU available"?
A: Runtime → Change runtime type → T4 GPU → Save

Q: "Module not found"?
A: Make sure you zipped the CONTENTS of iml-a3, not the folder itself

Q: Training too slow?
A: Colab T4 should be ~10x faster than CPU. Check GPU is active (Cell 1)

Q: Disconnected?
A: Colab disconnects after ~12 hours or if idle. Training should finish in 2-3 hours.

EXPECTED RESULTS
----------------
Baseline (CPU, 128x128):  ~9% accuracy
Improved (T4, 224x224):   20-30% accuracy target
Training time on T4:      2-3 hours
Model size:               122M parameters

After training, compare:
- models/approach_1_2/improved_cnn_lstm_colab_training.log
- With your baseline results
